This project was inspired by the many times that we went to the arcade and played the smashing hedgehog game that was a staple to all arcade games. We decided to put a twist on it though and try to implement a data structure to it that would make it more difficult as well as more complex. The way the game works is that the goal of the game is for the user to click off as many Avengers as possible.

We decided to take the point of view of Thanos that is a funny twist to the very popular Avengers movie. Where the user is taking the point of view of Thanos and is trying to get rid off the Avengers. There are three levels to the game that take the theme of the first three Avengers movies, Battle of New York, Age of Ultron and Infinity War. The three levels differ through difficulty as the higher the user chooses for the level, the faster the characters appear and less lives are given to the user.
